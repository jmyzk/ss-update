This sample code copies data from smartsheet and write to Appsheet using Smartsheet API.

What this code does is
Customer inputs data through Smartsheet form and the corresponding Smartsheet captures data.
Then using Smarthsset API, correspoinding data is copied to Appsheet.

I chose Smartsheet Form instead of Appsheet Form as it displays many rows of choices more user-friendly.
